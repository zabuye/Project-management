1. Testing for completeness. Do you have all the deliverables you expect to have?
2. Functionality testing. Does each deliverable do what it is meant to do?
3. Quality testing. Is each deliverable of the quality level required? Quality can be measured in many ways, but would include issues such as reliability.
4. Usability testing. Is each deliverable in a form that can be used easily by the customer, and that they are happy with?
5. Operational testing. When a deliverable is used in the real world, does it work as expected and can it be operated without disrupting everything else it interacts with?

1. Unit test. When the individual deliverables from the project are tested.
2. Integration test. When the deliverables are tested together as a complete working system.
3. User acceptance test. When the end users of the system test to see whether it works as they expected.
4. Operations test. When the integrated deliverables are tested within the live operational environment to ensure they work in the real world.

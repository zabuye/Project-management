- Ignore it altogether. If the likelihood is low and the potential impact is also low, then it is perfectly valid to ignore the risk.
- Monitor the risk. Do nothing, but periodically review the risk to make sure it is not becoming more critical. Some risks have a good combination of low likelihood and low impact but need to be monitored as either of these can change in some situations.
- Reduce the likelihood of it occurring. You have not reduced the impact but you have reduced the likelihood.
- To reduce the impact if it does occur. The alternative way to reduce risk is to take actions now to reduce the impact of a risk upon you if it does occur.

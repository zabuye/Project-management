Are you on schedule or not, relative to the plan? Are there any trends you are worried about?
If there is any [[slippage]], what is the impact? Are the late tasks on the critical path or not?
How much time are you late? So how much do you need to recover to bring yourself back on track? Are you likely to slip beyond your contingency time?
What options are there for recovering this time?
Which option is best?
